## How does it works? üßê

The AR Treasure Hunt project can be built to create a mobile game.

The project uses Unity 2022.3.15f1 and Google's ARCore Geospatial Creator API

The [Geospatial Creator API] anchors christmas items to specific GPS coordinates in the real world. The API can track a user's latitude, longitude and altitude on the earth. The user needs to follow the given cues inorder to discover the items.

> [!NOTE]  
> App works best in day time.

## Requirements üéØ

The app will require the following:

* Internet and GPS access.
* The experience works best outdoors.
* An [ARCore compatible device]: Android: Google Pixel 2 or later device for optimum performance.

## Developer Setup üë®‚Äçüíª

### Unity üëæ

1. [Download Unity version 2022.3.15f1] for compatibility. We recommend using [Unity Hub].
2. Clone this repo to your machine (optionally fork this repository if you plan on expanding on it).
3. Open the project in Unity 2022.3.15f1, and open the 'ARTreasureHunt' scene (if it doesn't open automatically).
4. Switch platform to Android (File > Build Settings > Choose Android Platform > Click on Switch Platform)
5. Follow the steps below in the 'ARCore API Key' section
6. Deploy it to an [ARCore compatible device] (File > Build Settings > Build & Run)

### ARCore API Key üîë

You'll need to set up API access to use the ARCore Geospatial API and the Google Map Tiles API 

1. Create a new [Google Cloud project][Create Google Cloud Project].
2. Enable the [ARCore API][ARCore API] and [Maptiles API][Google Map Tiles API] and [generate API keys].
3. Add the keys to your Unity Project:
   1. Open Unity Project Settings (Edit > Project Settings)
   2. Under 'XR Plug-in Management', click on 'ARCore Extensions'
   3. Paste the ARCore API Key into the 'Android API Key' textfield
   4. 'Geospatial' and 'Geospatial Creator' should be turned on
   5. Open the ARTreasureHunt Scene by Double Clicking it (Projects window > Assets > Scenes)
   6. Click on 'AR Geospatial Creator Origin' from the [Hierarchy window][Hierarchy Window]
   7. Paste the Map Tiles API Key under 'AR Geospatial Creator Script' component in the [Inspector window][Inspector Window]

### Changing the geographic coordinates of Christmas Items ‚ú®

1. Open the ARTreasureHunt Scene by Double Clicking it (Projects window > Assets > Scenes)
2. Click on any Christmas Item Model in the [Hierarchy window][Hierarchy Window] (eg. Christmas_Tree)
3. From the [Inspector window][Inspector Window], look for 'AR Geospatial Creator Anchor' and change the values for latitude, longitude, altitude to your desired location
